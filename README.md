# central-vermont-bike-share
Synthetic data creation tools for Central Vermont Bike Share proposal

## File Structure

1. `data/input/station-locations-and-activity.csv`

This file contains the following fields:
* `station_id` -- an integer identifying the station
* `station_name` -- a string identifying the station
* `longitude` -- a float for the longitude (not used)
* `latitude` -- a float for the latitude (not used)
* `daily_activity` -- an integer or float for an estimate of the activity at this location
* `bike_count` -- an integer for the number of docks at this station

2. `data/input/distance-between-stations.csv`

This file contains the following fields:
* `from` -- a string `station_name` for the starting station
* `to` -- a string `station_name` for the ending station
* `distance_in_km` -- a float, the distance in kilometers between the two stations

3. `notebooks/make-synthetic-data.ipynb` 
A Jupyter notebook that consumes the `input` files and generates synthetic data. Right now it is doing the following:

* Applying a gravity model based on the distance to get flows from one station to the next.
* Assigning each trip a random starting time and a more or less random duration (after accounting for the trip distance). 
* It is not keeping track of `bike_id`s or dock occupancy at the moment. 

4. `data/output/synthetic-trips.csv`

This file is generated by the above notebook and has the following fields:

* `trip_id` -- an integer identifying the trip
* `start_station_id` -- an integer `station_id` for the starting station
* `start_station_name` -- a string `station_name` for the starting station
*  start_date` -- a datetime field for the trip starting time
* `end_station_id` -- an integer `station_id` for the ending station
* `end_station_name` a string `station_name` for the ending station
* `end_date` -- a datetime field for the trip ending time

## Instructions
1. Recommend using the `uv` [package manager](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/).
2. Once `uv` is installed, go to the same directory level as the `pyproject.toml` and `uv.lock` files and type `uv sync`. 
3. At a command prompt, type `uv run --with jupyter jupyter lab` to start a Jupyter notebook.
4. Run the `make-synthetic-data.ipynb` notebook to generate the results.
